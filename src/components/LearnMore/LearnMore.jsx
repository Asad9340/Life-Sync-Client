          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Donating blood can save up to three lives. Blood is needed for
            surgeries, cancer treatments, chronic illnesses, and traumatic
            injuries. It is essential for patients in need and can make a
            significant difference in their recovery and survival.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Blood donation helps your community. Blood banks and hospitals rely
